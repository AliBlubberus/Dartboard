<p>I've played around with node servers a little and came to the conclusion that it would be a

So I'm gonna host some special rank sprites and stuff here.

I still have to decide wether I'm gonna host public leaderboards.
Not only because of laws and stuff, but also because it is really easy to cheat in this game.
Just open up chrome devtools and you're good to go.
<br>
I'm not saying you should do it. It's only for debugging purposes.
<br>
But yee...
