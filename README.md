<h1>Dartboard</h1>

Dartboard is an app which helps you record your games of darts.
You can keep track of everyone of your friend's scores and how they've improved over time.
While playing, you gather XP and complete Quests to keep you motivated to improve.

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Why I started this Project</h3>
I had been playing a lot of darts lately. And since we had a traditional dartboard without any electronics, we needed some way to record our games and keep track of our scores.
We have decided to try some of the many free apps and programs out there that could do this. And while all of them delivered on their promises, each one of them had something bothering me... Ads, weird UI alignments when in horizontal mode, and oldschool graphics to name a few. With this app, i decided to try and change that for the better. So I am going for:

<ul>
  <li>An Ad-Free experience</li>
  <li>Good looking UI</li>
  <li>Many quality-of-life features</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>EXP-System</li>
  <li>"Quests"-Tab</li>
  <li><del>Ranking System</del></li>
  <li>Server Backend</li>
 </ul>
